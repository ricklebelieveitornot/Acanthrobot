To Run Arduino Files:
Put the .ino File in a separate folder named the same as the .ino file
Open .ino file with Arduino IDE
Compile and Upload Code to Arduino Board

Run ServoSetUp.ino if actually physically building the robot;
Run ArcanthrobotFinal.ino if you already have the robot built and want it to move;
